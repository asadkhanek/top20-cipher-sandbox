  "description": "CAST-128 (also known as CAST5) is a symmetric key block cipher with a Feistel structure. It's the default cipher in OpenPGP and supports variable key lengths from 40 to 128 bits.",
  "history": "CAST-128 was developed by Carlisle Adams and Stafford Tavares in 1996. It became widely known as the default encryption algorithm in OpenPGP (Pretty Good Privacy) software.",
