  "description": "Serpent is a symmetric key block cipher that was one of the five finalists in the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) contest. It was designed with a conservative approach, prioritizing security over speed.",
  "history": "Serpent was designed by Ross Anderson, Eli Biham, and Lars Knudsen in 1998 as a candidate for the AES. Although Rijndael (now AES) was selected, Serpent was noted for having the highest security margin among the finalists.",
  "features": [
    "32 rounds (highest among AES finalists)",
    "Conservative security design",
    "Variable key length (128, 192, 256 bits)",
    "128-bit block size",
    "High security margin"
  ],
  "advantages": [
    "Highest security margin among AES finalists",
    "Very secure against known attacks",
    "Simple and elegant design",
    "Resistant to timing attacks"
