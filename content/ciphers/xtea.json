  "description": "Extended Tiny Encryption Algorithm (XTEA) is a block cipher designed to correct weaknesses in TEA. It uses a more complex key schedule and is more resistant to related-key attacks.",
  "history": "XTEA was designed by David Wheeler and Roger Needham in 1997 as an improvement over their original TEA algorithm. It addresses several security weaknesses found in TEA while maintaining simplicity.",
  "features": [
    "Improved key schedule over TEA",
    "32 rounds",
    "128-bit key",
    "64-bit block size",
    "Feistel structure",
    "More secure than original TEA"
  ],
  "advantages": [
    "Simple to implement",
    "Fixes TEA's known weaknesses",
    "Fast execution",
    "Low memory requirements",
    "Good for embedded systems"
