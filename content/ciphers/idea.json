  "description": "International Data Encryption Algorithm (IDEA) is a symmetric key block cipher designed to replace DES. It was used in early versions of PGP and offers strong security with a unique design using mixed operations.",
  "history": "IDEA was developed by Xuejia Lai and James Massey at ETH Zurich in 1991 as a replacement for DES. It became famous for its use in Pretty Good Privacy (PGP) software and remained patented until 2012.",
  "features": [
    "128-bit key length",
    "64-bit block size",
    "8.5 rounds",
    "Mixed operations (XOR, addition mod 2^16, multiplication mod 2^16+1)",
    "Strong mathematical foundation"
  ],
  "advantages": [
    "Strong security design",
    "Resistant to differential and linear cryptanalysis",
    "Simple and elegant structure",
    "Good performance in software",
    "Patent-free since 2012"
  ],
  "disadvantages": [
    "64-bit block size vulnerable to birthday attacks",
