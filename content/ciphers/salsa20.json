  "description": "Salsa20 is a stream cipher built on a pseudorandom function based on add-rotate-xor (ARX) operations. It's designed for high speed in software implementations while maintaining strong security.",
  "history": "Salsa20 was designed by Daniel J. Bernstein and submitted to the eSTREAM project in 2005. It was selected for the eSTREAM portfolio for software-oriented stream ciphers and has influenced many subsequent cipher designs.",
