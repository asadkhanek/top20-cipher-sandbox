  "description": "Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC) is an approach to public-key cryptography based on the algebraic structure of elliptic curves over finite fields. ECC provides the same level of security as RSA with significantly smaller key sizes.",
  "history": "ECC was independently proposed by Neal Koblitz and Victor Miller in 1985. It has become increasingly popular due to its efficiency and strong security properties, especially in mobile and embedded systems.",
  "features": [
    "Smaller key sizes than RSA for equivalent security",
    "Fast key generation and digital signatures",
    "Efficient in bandwidth and storage",
    "Strong mathematical foundation",
    "Various standardized curves"
  ],
  "advantages": [
    "Much smaller key sizes (256-bit ECC â‰ˆ 3072-bit RSA)",
    "Lower computational overhead",
    "Faster key generation",
    "Less bandwidth and storage requirements",
    "Better performance on mobile devices"
  ],
